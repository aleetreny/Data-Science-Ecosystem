# Optimization and Decision Analytics Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository showcases the application of **Linear Programming (LP)**, **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**, and **Regression Modeling** techniques to solve complex resource allocation, production planning, and predictive analysis problems.

The projects demonstrate proficiency in mathematical formulation, solver implementation (e.g., Gurobi), advanced analysis (Duality, Sensitivity), and professional report generation.

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Problem 1: Linear Optimization and Predictive Modeling
* **Linear Programming (LP):** Formulating and solving the Primal and Dual problems for optimal resource allocation.
* **Duality and Interpretation:** Applying complementary slackness conditions and graphical methods to find optimal primal/dual solutions.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Performing analysis on the Right-Hand Sides (RHS) and Objective Coefficients to determine the stability of the optimal solution and interpret shadow prices.
* **MAE Regression:** Formulating a multi-variable regression problem as a Linear Program under the Mean Absolute Error criterion.

### Problem 2: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
* **Production Planning:** Modeling a complex manufacturing scenario with multiple products and resource constraints.
* **Fixed Costs & Logic:** Incorporating fixed costs and logical constraints using binary variables (MILP).
* **Piecewise Profit Functions:** Linearizing non-linear profit structures (declining marginal profits) within the MILP framework.
